## Bug #1: Security Vulnerability - Hardcoded API Keys in Environment Variables

### **Type**: Security Vulnerability
### **Severity**: Critical
### **Location**: Multiple files (main.py, api_routes.py, match_prediction.py)

### **Description**
The application exposes sensitive API keys as hardcoded fallback values in `os.environ.get()` calls. This is a major security vulnerability that exposes production API keys in the source code.

### **Evidence**
```python
# main.py line 61
api_key = os.environ.get('APIFOOTBALL_API_KEY', 'aa2b2ffba35e4c25666961de6fd2f51419adeb32cc9d56394012f8e5067682df')

# api_routes.py lines 38-39
FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY = os.environ.get('FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY', '668dd03e0aea41b58fce760cdf4eddc8')
API_FOOTBALL_KEY = os.environ.get('APIFOOTBALL_API_KEY', 'aa2b2ffba35e4c25666961de6fd2f51419adeb32cc9d56394012f8e5067682df')

# match_prediction.py line 70
self.api_key = os.environ.get('APIFOOTBALL_PREMIUM_KEY', 'aa2b2ffba35e4c25666961de6fd2f51419adeb32cc9d56394012f8e5067682df')
```

### **Risk**
- API keys are exposed in version control
- Unauthorized usage and potential rate limiting
- Potential financial liability from API overuse
- Security breach if keys are compromised

### **Impact**
- Critical security vulnerability
- Violates security best practices
- Could lead to service disruption

## Bug #2: Logic Error - Missing sys Module Import

### **Type**: Logic Error
### **Severity**: High
### **Location**: match_prediction.py line 232

### **Description**
The `save_cache()` method uses `sys.modules` to check for numpy availability but doesn't import the `sys` module, causing a `NameError` at runtime.

### **Evidence**
```python
# match_prediction.py line 232
if 'numpy' in sys.modules:  # sys is not imported!
    import numpy as np
```

### **Risk**
- Runtime `NameError: name 'sys' is not defined`
- Cache saving functionality fails completely
- Loss of prediction data and performance degradation

### **Impact**
- Application crashes when trying to save predictions
- Data loss and poor user experience
- Performance issues due to failed caching

## Bug #3: Performance Issue - HTTP Requests Without Timeouts

### **Type**: Performance Issue
### **Severity**: Medium-High
### **Location**: Multiple files with requests.get() calls

### **Description**
All HTTP requests using `requests.get()` lack timeout parameters, which can cause the application to hang indefinitely when external APIs are slow or unresponsive.

### **Evidence**
```python
# main.py line 75
response = requests.get(url, params=params)  # No timeout

# api_routes.py line 175
response = requests.get(url, params=params)  # No timeout

# Multiple other locations with same issue
```

### **Risk**
- Application can hang indefinitely
- Poor user experience with long loading times
- Resource exhaustion from hanging connections
- Potential DoS vulnerability

### **Impact**
- Application becomes unresponsive
- Server resources consumed by hanging requests
- Poor scalability and reliability

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Remove Hardcoded API Keys
- Replaced hardcoded API keys with `None` as fallback
- Added proper error handling when API keys are missing
- Application now fails safely with clear error messages
- Logs warnings when environment variables are not set

### Fix #2: Add Missing sys Import
- Added `import sys` to match_prediction.py
- Fixed the numpy module detection logic
- Ensured cache saving functionality works correctly

### Fix #3: Add Request Timeouts
- Added 30-second timeouts to all `requests.get()` calls
- Implemented proper error handling for timeout scenarios
- Added retry logic for critical API calls
- Improved application reliability and performance

## Verification
- All fixes have been tested and verified
- No breaking changes introduced
- Application maintains full functionality
- Security posture significantly improved
- Performance and reliability enhanced
